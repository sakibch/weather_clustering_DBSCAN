# weather_clustering_DBSCAN

**DENSITY BASED SPATIAL CLUSTERING**

Most of the traditional clustering techniques, such as k-means, hierarchical and fuzzy clustering, can be used to group data without supervision.

However, when applied to tasks with arbitrary shape clusters, or clusters within cluster, the traditional techniques might be unable to achieve good results. That is, elements in the same cluster might not share enough similarity or the performance may be poor. 

Additionally, Density-based Clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density. Density, in this context, is defined as the number of points within a specified radius.

In this notebook, the main focus will be manipulating the data and properties of DBSCAN and observing the resulting clustering.
